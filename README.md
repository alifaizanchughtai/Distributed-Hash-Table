# Python Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

This repository contains an implementation of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) in Python. A DHT is a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table; key-value pairs are stored in a distributed network of nodes, allowing for efficient and scalable data retrieval.

## Overview

The DHT implementation in this repository includes the following features:

- Peer-to-peer network architecture with nodes that can join and leave the network dynamically.
- Consistent hashing for distributing key-value pairs across nodes.
- Efficient lookup algorithm to retrieve values associated with keys.
- Fault tolerance to handle node failures gracefully.
